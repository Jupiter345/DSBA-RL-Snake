# Implementation of Deep Q-Network and SARSA Agents to Solve Snake Game Environment

In this project, we aimed to develop a text based Snake game environment. To train the agent in the Snake environment, we implemented the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) reinforcement learning algorithms. The focus of this project was to compare the performance of the DQN and SARSA agents in terms of their ability to learn and play the game optimally. The agents learned to base their decisions on the game's current state by modeling the Snake environment as a Markov decision process. Both agents were able to learn how to play the game, according to the comparison's findings, but the DQN agent outperformed the SARSA agent in terms of scoring more points and playing the game longer. The study shows how reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to teach AI agents how to play games and perform other challenging tasks.

This project was completed as a part of Reinforement Learning course in Masters in Data Science and Business Analytics. The Authors of this project are Anmol Katiyar and Swapnil Pade.
